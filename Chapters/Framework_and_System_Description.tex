\section{Overview}

This chapter introduces the framework that is the basis of this thesis. We start with a description of the ABE scheme that plays an essential role in providing the features of security and privacy for the framework. The construction of the ABE scheme follows after the definition of the various algorithms. The construction shows the mathematical concepts that confirm the inner workings of the different algorithms.

A description of the entire framework follows with the architecture and its corresponding entities highlighted. We then provide use cases together with a detailed description of the individual use cases and the roles the entities play.


\section{Proposed Multiple Authority Ciphertext Policy Attribute Based Encryption with Outsourced Decryption}

This section contains the formal definition of the underlying proposed ABE scheme for the overall framework. This formal definition provides a description of the algorithms that are part of the ABE scheme. The second part of the section provides more detailed information in the form of the mathematical construction for the ABE scheme.

\subsection{ABE Scheme Algorithm and Security Definition}

Our ABE scheme has been adapted from the scheme developed in \cite{Yang2014}. Using similar methods applied in \cite{Green2011outsource}, we have modified the scheme with the aim of outsourcing the bulk of the decryption algorithm operation to the CSP. This section contains a definition of the algorithms that make up our ABE scheme.

\subsubsection*{Algorithm Definitions}

The following algorithms make up the ABE scheme. These algorithms include: the setup and system initialization algorithms, the secret key generation algorithm, the encryption, transformation and decryption algorithms as well as the revocation algorithms. They are described a follows: 
%The setup algorithms are run as a part of the initialization stage of the ABE scheme. These algorithms are responsible for the registration of the other entities in the system. This also provides them with the necessary information for verifying their identity when communicating with other entities in the system and other vital information they need in order to execute their own operations.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
	
	\item CASetup - The Certificate Authority Setup algorithm is the algorithm executed by the Certificate Authority (CA) in order to generate the Global Master Key (GMK) and Global Public Parameters (GPP) of the entire scheme. It takes as input the security parameter of the scheme.  The CA makes the GPP available to all entities in the system.
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item UserReg - The User Registration algorithm is run by the CA whenever new users are being added to the system. The CA assigns a unique id to each new user and also generates two public-private key pairs together with user certificates and their corresponding verification keys for each new user. The CA sends one each of the generated public and private keys to the user together with the certificate.
		
		\item AAReg - The Attribute Authority Registration algorithm is run by the CA whenever new Attribute Authorities (AA) are joining the system. The CA assigns a unique id to each new AA and also send the other public and private keys for each registered user to the AA together with the verification keys for the generated certificates.
		
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item AASetup - The Attribute Authority Setup algorithm is run by the individual Attribute Authorities (AAs) and generates the public-secret key pair for the attribute authority. It also generates a public-version key pair for each of the attributes under the control of the AA that is provided as input in the AA universal attribute set.
	
	\item SKGen - The Secret Key Generation algorithm is run by the corresponding AAs in order to provide the user with the secret key for the attributes that they have been assigned. The AA takes as input the system GPP, the users Global Public Keys (GPKs), one of the user GSKs, the set of attributes and their corresponding public-version key pairs. It provides the user with a secret key that can be used for decryption.
	
	\item Encrypt - The Encryption algorithm is run by the data owner in order to encrypt the corresponding piece of data. This algorithm takes as input the system GPP, the public keys (PKs) for the AAs involved in the encryption - as they are in control of the attributes that make up the policy under which data is to be encrypted - of the data, and an access policy. It provides as output a ciphertext (CT) which implicitly contains the corresponding access policy.
	
	\item CTransform - The Ciphertext Transformation algorithm is responsible for the transformation of the CT into an El Gamal style ciphertext that can be easily decrypted by the end user. This algorithm is executed by the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) and takes as input the ciphertext, the secret keys of the attributes in the user's possession and the user's GPK. It produces as output a partially decrypted ciphertext (CT') if the user's secret keys meet the policy under which the data was encrypted, otherwise it outputs an error.
	
	\item Decrypt - The Decryption algorithm is run by the end user and takes as input the partially decrypted ciphertext (CT') and the user's global secret key which is not shared with any other entity in the system and produces the original data as output for the user in its plain form.
	
	\item UKeyGen - The Update Key Generation algorithm is run by the AA under whose control the revoked attribute falls. The algorithm takes as input the SK of the AA, the revoked attribute and the current version key for the revoked attribute. It produces as output an updated version key for the revoked attribute. It also produces an update key to be used to update the corresponding secret keys of users who possess the revoked attributes and whose access is not being revoked. It also produces an update key for the affected ciphertexts whose access policies contain the revoked attribute to allow for users who still maintain access to be able to decrypt while denying revoked users further access.
	
	\item SKUpdate - The Secret Key Update algorithm is run by each non revoked user in the system and takes as input the corresponding secret key acquired from the AA that control the affected attribute together with the update key for user secret keys generated by the UKeyGen algorithm. It outputs a new secret key for the user.
	
	\item CTUpdate - The Ciphertext Update algorithm is run the CSP and takes as input the affected ciphertexts and the update key generated by the UKeyGen algorithm for ciphertext update. it outputs a new ciphertext that can only be decrypted by users with a current version of the corresponding revoked attribute.
	
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{ABE Scheme Security Definition}\label{secdef}

The security definition of the ABE scheme is based on the correctness definition of the scheme based on the following conditions:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
	\item Encryption and Decryption - Decrypt(CTransform(Encrypt(Message, GPP, $PK_{aids}$), $SK_{uid,aid}$, $GPK_{uid}$), $GSK'_{uid}$) = Message
	
	\item Revocation - For an attribute $\tilde{x}_{aid'}$, Decrypt(CTransform(CTUpdate(Encrypt(\\Message, GPP, $PK_{aids}$), ${UK}_{c,\tilde{x}_{aid'},uid}$), $SK_{uid,aid}$, $GPK_{uid}$), $GSK'_{uid}$) = Message, only if version key for $\tilde{K}_{\tilde{x}_{aid'},uid}$ = version key for $\tilde{x}_{aid'}$
\end{enumerate}

This scheme is secure under the CPA model of security. Further analysis of the security of the underlying ABE scheme together with the security game model and proofs can be found in \cite{Yang2014}, the original scheme from which this was derived.

We also adopt the security assumptions of the original  scheme \cite{Yang2014}. The security assumptions are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
	\item We assume the CA is fully trusted in the sense that it will not collude with any users in the system but it should not be able to decrypt any of the ciphertexts in the system alone.
	
	\item Attribute Authorities are trusted but can be corrupted by an adversary.
	
	\item The Cloud Service Provider is semi-trusted. By semi-trusted this means that the CSP may want to acquire additional knowledge of the data content, but will always execute tasks/algorithms accurately \cite{Yang2014}.
	
	\item We assume that users are dishonest and may potentially collude with other dishonest parties to gain unauthorized access to data.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{ABE Scheme Construction}

\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item CA Setup - This procedure is run by the CA to setup the system
	\begin{align}
	\begin{split}
	CASetup(1^{\lambda}) \longrightarrow GMK, GPP
	\end{split}
	\end{align}
	where $ 1^{\lambda} $ is the security parameter, $ GMK $ is the Global Master Key, and $ GPP $ represents the Global Public Parameters.
	
	The CA chooses two multiplicative groups $ G, G_{T} $ with the same prime order $ p $ and a bilinear map $ e \colon G \times G \rightarrow G_{T} $ and a hash function $ H \colon \{0, 1\} \rightarrow G. $ The CA chooses two random numbers $ a, b \in Z_{p} $
	
	The GMK is set as $ (a, b) $ and the GPP is set to $ (g, g^{a}, g^{b}, H) $
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item User Registration - This is executed for all users in the system by the CA. Each user is assigned a globally unique $ uid $ and for each $ uid $, the CA generates two random numbers $ u_{uid}, u'_{uid} \in Z_{p} $ as its global secret keys
		\begin{align}
		\begin{split}
		&GSK_{uid} = u_{uid}, \\ &GSK'_{uid} = u'_{uid}
		\end{split}
		\end{align}
		The global public keys for each user is generated as 
		\begin{align}
		\begin{split}
		&GPK_{uid} = g^{u_{uid}}, \\ &GPK'_{uid} = g^{\frac{1}{u'_{uid}}}
		\end{split}
		\end{align}
		The CA generates a $ Certificate(uid) $ for each user $ uid $ and sends $ (GPK_{uid}, \\GSK'_{uid}, Cerificate(uid)) $ to the user.
		
		\item Attribute Authority (AA) Registration - The CA assigns a globally unique authority identity $ aid $ to each AA and sends $ (GPK'_{uid}, GSK_{uid}) $ for all registered users to $ AA_{aid} $. The CA also sends the verification key $ vk_{CA} $ to $ AA_{aid} $ for verifying the $ Certificate(uid) $ assigned to each user.
		
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item AA Setup - Let $ X_{aid} $ be the set of all attributes managed by $ AA_{aid} $. The AA generates three random numbers $ \alpha_{aid}, \beta_{aid}, \gamma_{aid} \in Z_{p} $ as its secret key.
	\begin{align}
	\begin{split}
	&SK_{aid} = (\alpha_{aid}, \beta_{aid}, \gamma_{aid}) \\
	&PK_{aid} = (e(g, g)^{\alpha_{aid}}, g^{\beta_{aid}}, g^{\frac{1}{\beta_{aid}}})
	\end{split}
	\end{align}
	For each attribute $ x_{aid} \in X_{aid} $, $ AA_{aid} $ generates a public attribute key as $ PK_{x_{aid}} = (PK_{1, x_{aid}} = H(x_{aid})^{v_{x_{aid}}}, PK_{2, x_{aid}} = H(x_{aid})^{v_{x_{aid}}\gamma_{aid}}) $ where $ v_{x_{aid}} $ is the version key of attribute $ x_{aid} $ i.e $ VK_{x_{aid}} = v_{x_{aid}} $.
	
	\item Secret Key Generation - The Attribute Authority with $ AA_{aid} $ assigns a set of attributes $ S_{uid,aid} $ to user with $ uid $ after authentication and certificate verification. The AA chooses a random number $ t_{uid,aid} \in Z_{p} $ and computes a secret key for the user $SK_{uid,aid}$ as
	\begin{align}
	\begin{split}
	&K_{uid,aid} = g^{\frac{\alpha_{aid}}{u'_{uid}}}g^{au_{uid}}g^{bt_{uid,aid}},\\ &K'_{uid,aid} = g^{t_{uid,aid}}, \\
	\forall x_{aid} \in S_{uid,aid} \colon &K_{x_{aid},uid} = g^{t_{uid,aid}\beta_{aid}}H(x_{aid})^{v_{x_{aid}}\beta_{aid}(u_{uid} + \gamma_{aid})})
	\end{split}
	\end{align}
	If the user $ uid $ does not hold any attributes from $ AA_{aid} $, the user secret key $ SK_{uid,aid} $ only contains $ K_{uid,aid} $.
	
	\item Encryption - Data is divided into components based on the level of granularity required for access control i.e $ m = \{m_{i}, \cdots, m_{n}\} $. Data components are encrypted using symmetric encryption keys $ \kappa = \{\kappa_{i}, \cdots, \kappa_{n}\} $. An access structure $ (M_{k}, \rho) $ is defined for each content key $ \kappa_{i} (i = 1, \cdots, n) $ and encrypted using the ABE scheme to produce the corresponding ciphertext. Let M be an $\ell$ x n matrix, where $\ell$ denotes the total number of all the attributes and the function $ \rho $ associates rows of M to attributes. The function $\rho$ is not required to be injective which allows for an attribute to be associated with more than one row of M.
	
	To encrypt the content key $\kappa_{i}$, the algorithm chooses a random element $ s \in Z_{p} $ which is used as the random encryption exponent. It then selects a random vector $ \vec{v} = (s, y_{2},\ldots,y_{n}) \in Z_{p} $ where $ y_{2},\ldots,y_{n} $ are used to share the encryption exponent s. It then computes $ \forall 1 \leq i \leq \ell: \lambda_{i} = \vec{v}.M_{i} $ where $ M_{i} $ is the vector corresponding to the i-th row of M. It then randomly selects $ r_{1},r_{2},\ldots,r_{\ell} $ and computes the ciphertext $CT_{K_{i}}$ as	
	\begin{align}
	\begin{split}
	&C = K_{i}\cdot\Bigl(\prod\limits_{aid_{k} \in I_{A}}PK_{aid_{k}}\Bigl)^{s}, \\ &C' = g^{s}, \\ &C'' = g^{bs},\\
	\forall 1 \leq i \leq \ell, \rho(i) \in X_{aid_{k}} \colon &C_{i} = g^{a\lambda_{i}\cdot\bigl(PK_{i,\rho(i)}\bigl)^{-r_{i}}},\\ &C'_{i} = g^{r_{i}}, \\ &D_{i} = g^{\frac{r_{i}}{\beta_{aid_k}}}, \\ &D'_{i} = \Bigl(PK_{2,\rho_{(i)}}\Bigl)^{r_{i}}
	\end{split}
	\end{align}
	Then the encrypted data is uploaded to the cloud server by the owner.
	
	\item Ciphertext Transformation - This involves the transformation of the ciphertext into an El Gamal style ciphertext referred to in this framework as a token through partial decryption while the integrity of the original message is preserved.
	
	The transformation algorithm takes as input the ciphertext $CT$ where $CT = (C, C', C'', C_1,\ldots,C_\ell)$ which contains an access policy $(M,\rho)$, the user's global public key $GPK_{uid}$, and a set of secret keys from all the involved Attribute Authorities $\{SK_{uid,aid}\}_{aid_k \in I_{A}}$ i.e $(K, K', K_{x_{aid}} \forall x_{aid} \in S_{aid})$ where $S_{aid}$ is a set of the user attributes. If the attributes provided do not meet the access policy conditions, the algorithm outputs $\perp$. The algorithm proceeds to transform the ciphertext if the set of user attributes $S_{aid}$ meet the conditions of the access policy contained in the ciphertext.
	
	Let $I$ be defined as $\{I_{aid_k} \in I_{A}\}$, where $I_{aid_k} \subset \{1,2,\ldots,\ell\}$ can be defined as $I_{aid_k} = \{i: \rho(i) \in S_{aid_k}\}$. Let $n_A = |I_A|$ be the number of AAs  involved in the access policy of the ciphertext. The algorithm chooses a set of constants $\{\omega_{i} \in Z_p\}_{i \in I}$ such that if the shares of a secret represented by $\{\lambda_{i}\}$ are valid with respect to the matrix component of the access structure, $M$, then the secret can be reconstructed as $\sum_{i \in I}\omega_{i}\lambda_{i}$. The algorithm computes the partially decrypted ciphertext $CT'$ as
	
	\begin{align}
	&= \prod\limits_{aid_{k} \in I_{A}} \frac{e\Bigl(C', K_{uid,aid}\Bigl)e\Bigl(C'', K'_{uid,aid}\Bigl)^{-1}}{\prod\limits_{i \in I_{aid_k}}\biggl(e\Bigl(C_i, GPK_{uid}\Bigl)e\Bigl(D_i, K_{\rho(i),uid}\Bigl)e\Bigl(C'_i, K_{uid,aid_k}^{-1}\Bigl)e\Bigl(g, D'_i\Bigl)^{-1}\biggl)^{\omega_{i}n_A}} \nonumber \\
	&= \prod\limits_{aid_{k} \in I_{A}} e\Bigl(g, g\Bigl)^{\frac{s\alpha_{aid}}{u'_{uid}}}
	\end{align}
	
	%$\omega_{i}$ - constant chosen for the reconstruction of encryption exponent s using shares $\lambda_{i}$
	
	%$n_A$ - number of AAs involved in the ciphertext
	
	%$\rho(i)$ - mapping of each row of access structure to attribute i
	
	%\begin{align*}
	%CT' = \prod\limits_{aid_{k} \in I_{A}} e\Bigl(g, g\Bigl)^{\frac{s\alpha_{aid}}{u'_{uid}}}
	%\end{align*}
	
	\item Decryption - The algorithm for decryption takes as input the partially decrypted ciphertext ($CT'$) and the user's secret key and produces as output the original message. It performs an exponentiation on $CT'$ in order to derive the blinding element (BE) of the original message as
	%The user does an exponentiation on the partially decrypted ciphertext to get the blinding element (BE) for decryption.
	
	\begin{align}
	\begin{split}
	&= CT'^{u'_{uid}} \\ &= \prod\limits_{aid_{k} \in I_{A}} e\Bigl(g, g\Bigl)^{s\alpha_{aid}}
	\end{split}
	\end{align}
	
	Remember the $C$ element of the main ciphertext $= K_i\cdot\bigl(\prod\limits_{aid_{k} \in I_{A}}PK_{aid_{k}}\bigl)^{s}$ where $PK_{aid_{k}} = e\bigl(g, g\bigl)^{\alpha_{aid}}$. Therefore the original message which in this case is the symmetric key $K$ is computed as
	
	\begin{align}
	\begin{split}
	= \frac{C}{BE}
	\end{split}
	\end{align}
	
	\item User Revocation - User revocation which can also be referred to as attribute revocation as used in some of the literature on the subject should achieve two critical criteria. The revoked user should not be able to decrypt new ciphertexts which have been encrypted using the public attribute keys of attributes that the user was previously granted private keys for. This is referred to as Backward Security. Any new user who has the right attributes should be able to decrypt the original ciphertexts that were encrypted using those public parameters. This is referred to a Forward Security. The revocation algorithm used has been gotten from the scheme by Yang et. al in \cite{Yang2014}.
	
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Update Key Generation - In order to revoke an attribute $\tilde{x}_{aid'}$ from a particular user, the attribute authority (AA) responsible $AA_{aid'}$ runs the key update algorithm taking as input the secret key $SK_{aid'}$ of the 
		attribute authority, the revoked attribute $\tilde{x}_{aid'}$, and its current version key $VK_{\tilde{x}_{aid'}}$.
		The algorithm generates a new version key $VK'_{\tilde{x}_{aid'}} = v'_{\tilde{x}_{aid'}} (v'_{\tilde{x}_{aid'}} \neq v_{\tilde{x}_{aid'}})$ for the revoked attribute $\tilde{x}_{ai'd}$.
		
		The $AA_{aid'}$ then generates a unique update key ${UK}_{s,\tilde{x}_{aid'},uid}$ for secret key update by each non-revoked user $uid$ as
		\begin{align}
		\begin{split}
		{UK}_{s,\tilde{x}_{aid'},uid} = H(\tilde{x}_{aid'})^{\beta_{aid'}(v'_{\tilde{x}_{aid'}}-v_{\tilde{x}_{aid'}})(u_{uid}+\gamma_{aid'})}
		\end{split}
		\end{align}
		and generates the update key ${UK}_{c,\tilde{x}_{aid'},uid}$ for ciphertext update as
		\begin{align}
		\begin{split}
		&UK_{1,\tilde{x}_{aid'}} = \frac{v'_{\tilde{x}_{aid'}}}{v_{\tilde{x}_{aid'}}}, \\ &UK_{2,\tilde{x}_{aid'}} = \frac{v_{\tilde{x}_{aid'}} - v'_{\tilde{x}_{aid'}}}{v_{\tilde{x}_{aid'}}\gamma_{aid'}}
		\end{split}
		\end{align}
		The $AA_{aid'}$ sends the ${UK}_{s,\tilde{x}_{aid'},uid}$ to the non-revoked user $uid$ and sends ${UK}_{c,\tilde{x}_{aid'},uid}$ to the cloud server.
		
		The $AA_{aid'}$ then updates the public attribute key, $PK_{\tilde{x}_{aid'}}$ of the revoked attribute $\tilde{x}_{aid'}$ to $\tilde{PK}_{\tilde{x}_{aid'}}$ as
		\begin{align} \label{eq:1}
		\begin{split}
		\tilde{PK}_{\tilde{x}_{aid'}} = ({PK}_{\tilde{x}_{aid'}})^{UK_{1,\tilde{x}_{aid'}}}
		\end{split}
		\end{align}
		
		% This is equation \ref{eq:1}
		
		\item Secret Key Update - This process is run by the non revoked users in the system. The algorithm produces an updated secret key $\tilde{SK}_{uid,aid'}$ using the update key ${UK}_{s,\tilde{x}_{aid'},uid}$ for the individual users as
		\begin{align}
		\begin{split}
		&\tilde{K}_{uid,aid'} = {K}_{uid,aid'}, \\ &\tilde{K'}_{uid,aid'} = {K'}_{uid,aid'}, \\
		&\tilde{K}_{\tilde{x}_{aid'},uid} = {K}_{\tilde{x}_{aid'},uid}.{UK}_{s,\tilde{x}_{aid'},uid},\\
		\forall x_{aid'} \in S_{uid,aid'} \backslash \{ \tilde{x}_{aid'} \} \colon &\tilde{K}_{\tilde{x}_{aid'},uid} = {K}_{\tilde{x}_{aid'},uid}
		\end{split} 
		\end{align}
		
		\item Ciphertext Update - The ciphertext $CT$ is updated using ${UK}_{c,\tilde{x}_{aid'},uid}$ to $\tilde{CT}$ as
		\begin{align}
		\begin{split}
		&\tilde{C} = C, \\ &\tilde{C'} = C', \\ &\tilde{C''} = C'',\\
		\forall 1 \leq i \leq \ell : &\tilde{C'}_{i} = C'_{i}, \\ &\tilde{D}_{i} = D_{i},\\
		if \rho(i) = \tilde{x}_{aid'} : &\tilde{C'}_{i} = C_{i} . (D'_{i})^{UK_{2,\tilde{x}_{aid'}}}, \\ &\tilde{D'}_{i} = (D'_{i})^{UK_{1,\tilde{x}_{aid'}}},\\
		if \rho(i) \neq \tilde{x}_{aid'} : &\tilde{C}_{i} = C_{i}, \\ &\tilde{D'}_{i} = D'_{i}
		\end{split}
		\end{align}
	\end{enumerate}
	
\end{enumerate}


\section{Secure Privacy Preserving EHR Framework}

This section provides information about the privacy preserving EHR framework that is the main subject of this thesis. We provide a system architectural model that shows the different entities that are part of the framework and how they interact with each other to achieve the functionalities of this framework. We also provide specific use case scenarios together with a detailed description of the individual use cases to provide further information of the different settings in which the framework could be applied.

Our EHR framework is an improvement on the other existing ABE based health care exchange systems in different ways. Our underlying multi-authority scheme is a major improvement on the other single authority schemes in terms of robustness. Also the introduction of a Certificate Authority for user and authority identification allows for a decentralized system in which attribute authorities cannot collude in order to circumvent the system and gain access to data. Also our framework's use of an ABE scheme with outsourced decryption significantly improves its usability. This allows end users to use devices with low computational power to access the necessary data.

\subsection{System Architecture/Model}

The system architecture is made up of several entities that perform different functions with regards to their roles in the system.

\subsubsection*{System Entities}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
	\item Users - Users are the members of the system that add or request data. They could be either data owners or data users with individuals able to play both roles in general with the system.
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Data Owner (DO) - The DO is responsible for the generation of data to be stored on the platform and retains ownership of data for the duration of its life cycle. The Data Owner also specifies what requirements are to be met for any user to have access by indicating what attributes they should possess though the policy used for data encryption.
		
		\item Data User (DU) - The DU represents entities that require access to stored data. They are required to possess the right attributes in order to gain access to stored data on the cloud.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Certificate Authority (CA) - The CA plays the central role of assisting with the verification of the identity of the different entities to enable them to securely communicate with one another. It does this by providing the corresponding certificates and public parameters used in the verification process.
	
	\item Attribute Authority (AA) - The AA is responsible for providing the appropriate public and private key parameters for the different attributes under their control to the appropriate owners and users for the encryption and decryption of data. 
	
	\item Cloud Service Provider (CSP) - This entity provides the necessary storage facilities for data on the platform and also the processing capabilities for part of the operation related to the decryption of data.
	
\end{enumerate}

	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{"System Architecture Diagram"}
	\caption{System architecture diagram showing interaction between the multiple framework entities with numbers indicating the typical order of the interactions}
	\label{fig:sysarch}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{System Architecture}

Figure \ref{fig:sysarch} shows the complete architecture of the entire system framework, indicating the various entities and the different ways in which they interact with each other as part of the overall system. The numbers indicate a typical flow of the different interactions between the entities in the system.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Step 1 - Data owner owner registers with the CA to get their public-secret key pair, a certificate, and an ID. The public key would be used for the transformation of the ciphertext later through the CSP and the secret key will be used by the user to complete the decryption process on the user end.
	
	\item Step 2 - The CA sends the corresponding data to the user in response.
	
	\item Step 3 - The Attribute Authorities register with the CA and get an ID and corresponding user information which includes another public-secret key pair and a verification key for the user certificated generated by the CA.
	
	\item Step 4 - The CA sends the corresponding data to the AA in response.
	
	\item Step 5 - After setting up, the AA makes available to the data owners in the system, its public keys and the public key for the attributes to be used for encryption.
	
	\item Step 6 - The Data Owner encrypts the actual data using symmetric encryption and using ABE, encrypts the corresponding symmetric key. Both the encrypted data and encrypted symmetric key are uploaded to the cloud.
	
	\item Step 7 - Potential Data users request for the secret key of the attributes that they have been approved for.
	
	\item Step 8 - The AA send the corresponding secret keys generated for the users.
	
	\item Step 9 - Users request access to data from the CSP and provides the corresponding information which includes, their attribute secret keys and the public key they received from the CA.
	
	\item Step 10 - The CSP partially decrypts the symmetric key and send this to the user together with the encrypted data. The user then completes the decryption of the symmetric key using the secret key received from the CA and then using the symmetric key, decrypts the data.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Use Cases}

In a real world scenario, hospitals and other medical institutions would play either the role of data owner or data user depending on where the data is collected and where the data is to be used. Hospital A would be an owner for data generated at its location for its patient and Hospital A would be a user when it requires access to data generated at a different hospital which it needs for a range of reasons from treatment to research.

The Attribute Authorities (AAs) in the real world would range from the administrations at different levels in the different hospitals that are part of the framework, the Research Ethic Boards, the administrations at different levels in potential research partners like academic institutions (i.e Universities), etc.

The CSP could be any of the real world cloud service providers such as the AWS cloud, Google cloud to name a few while the CA could be provincial or federal authorities responsible for oversight and regulations related to health care and privacy.

The following figures and tables show different use case scenarios which capture multiple use cases within the framework and the accompanying tables show a more detailed of the use cases captures within the use case scenario diagrams.
