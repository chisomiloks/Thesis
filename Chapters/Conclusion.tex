\section{Overview}

This chapter provides a description of the contribution of this thesis and also provides recommendation fo future developments that could be implemented in extending the functionalities of the framework.

\section{Contribution}

The main contribution of this thesis is a framework for the exchange of electronic health data with significant decrease in the computational requirements in terms of time and resources. This is in response to the need to be able to securely exchange sensitive medical data not simply among medical practitioners but also with 3rd party partner such as researchers who contribute to developments in the area while preserving privacy and maintaining security which becomes a problem when the trust zone is extended to 3rd party computational services as provided by cloud service providers. We have modified an existing Attribute Based Encryption (ABE) scheme to enable the outsourcing of decryption in order ot allow end users use devices with low computational abilities to gain access to data securely. Our system uses symmetric key encryption to encrypt data and uses our ABE scheme to encrypt the symmetric key thereby providing an encryption scheme with in-built access control.

\section{Future Work}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Accountability..challenge as users share attributes
	\item Searchable Encryption
	
\end{itemize}

\textcolor{red}{- where it could go in terms of efficiency and accountability}
