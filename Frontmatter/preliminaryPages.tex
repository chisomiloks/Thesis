The need to protect user data from malicious and unauthorized access continues to present itself. This is especially true in the case of a system that includes a third party storage service, which limits the amount of control that the data owner has. The use of encryption for secure data storage has continued to evolve in order to meet the need for flexible and fine grained access control. This evolution has led to the development of Attribute Based Encryption (ABE) based on the concept of Identity Based Encryption (IBE), an extension of public key cryptography. ABE gives more control to the data owner and its application enables users make use of the technological advancements available to them.

In the area of health, there is a lot of data collected on a constant basis. This medical data is highly sensitive as it typically contains the personal information of the users together with other sensitive information that needs to remain private. This data is to be protected from unauthorized users while ensuring it is available in a controlled form to those who require access in order to provide care. There is also a need to share this data with 3rd parties such as universities and research institutes. This opens an avenue for these third parties to be able to carry out research using this data in order to contribute to the advancement of the field of health care. There is also a need to protect user privacy by ensuring that third parties only have access to the limited amount of data they require for their research while protecting the Personal Identifiable Information (PII) of users. There is also a need to follow the guidelines set by the laws with regards to user data privacy.

Advancements in the area of technology such as cloud computing has expanded the trust boundaries of user systems while providing multiple advantages such as potentially unlimited access to storage and computational resources. In order to take advantage of these resources while maintaining the same levels of security and privacy, mechanisms need to be deployed. This is because users do not have physical control of the devices that are providing this resources and so need to be able to protect their data from a potentially compromised system administrator (i.e the Cloud Service Provider). There is a need to find a balance between providing adequate levels of security and finding a way to provide effective fine-grained access control to potential users. ABE provides an effective mechanism that fits this requirement as its use of attributes to regulate access provides embedded access control together with the security provided by it cryptograhic system.

The use of ABE to ensure the security and privacy of health data has been explored with multiple solutions proposed. This thesis aims to develop a framework that applies an improved ABE scheme which allows for the secure outsourcing of the more computationally intensive processes for data decryption to the cloud servers, reducing the amount of time needed for decryption to occur at the user end and also reducing the amount of computational power needed by users who require access to the data stored in the cloud in its encrypted form.
