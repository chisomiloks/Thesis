	abstract = {As cloud computing becomes prevalent, more and more sensitive data is being centralized into the cloud for sharing, which brings forth new challenges for outsourced data security and privacy. Attribute-based encryption (ABE) is a promising cryptographic primitive, which has been widely applied to design fine-grained access control system recently. However, ABE is being criticized for its high scheme overhead as the computational cost grows with the complexity of the access formula. This disadvantage becomes more serious for mobile devices because they have constrained computing resources. Aiming at tackling the challenge above, we present a generic and efficient solution to implement attribute-based access control system by introducing secure outsourcing techniques into ABE. More precisely, two cloud service providers (CSPs), namely key generation-cloud service provider (KG-CSP) and decryption-cloud service provider (D-CSP) are introduced to perform the outsourced key-issuing and decryption on behalf of attribute authority and users respectively. In order to outsource heavy computation to both CSPs without private information leakage, we formulize an underlying primitive called outsourced ABE (OABE) and propose several constructions with outsourced decryption and key-issuing. Finally, extensive experiment demonstrates that with the help of KG-CSP and D-CSP, efficient key-issuing and decryption are achieved in our constructions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

	abstract = {Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) is a promising cryptographic primitive which significantly enhances the versatility of access control mechanisms. Due to the high expressiveness of ABE policies, the computational complexities of ABE key-issuing and decryption are getting prohibitively high. Despite that the existing Outsourced ABE solutions are able to offload some intensive computing tasks to a third party, the verifiability of results returned from the third party has yet to be addressed. Aiming at tackling the challenge above, we propose a new Secure Outsourced ABE system, which supports both secure outsourced key-issuing and decryption. Our new method offloads all access policy and attribute related operations in the key-issuing process or decryption to a Key Generation Service Provider (KGSP) and a Decryption Service Provider (DSP), respectively, leaving only a constant number of simple operations for the attribute authority and eligible users to perform locally. In addition, for the first time, we propose an outsourced ABE construction which provides checkability of the outsourced computation results in an efficient way. Extensive security and performance analysis show that the proposed schemes are proven secure and practical. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

Furthermore, decryption should also be outsourced for higher efficiency. Researchers have been extending existing ABE schemes for these goals. Yet, the rationales are often hidden behind tailor-made number-theoretic constructions. This paper proposes a framework for constructing multi-authority ABE schemes with attribute revocation and out-sourced decryption, from any pairing-based single-authority ABE scheme which satisfies a set of properties we identified.},
